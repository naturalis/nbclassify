# Sticky traps website

This repo is the directory in wich the website for the sticky-traps website is placed.
The website was developed as part of a project involving the "Louis Bolk Instituut", "Kennis centrum EIS" and Naturalis.
The design was based on the original OrchID website, whilst the actual website was made according to the needs of the project.

The script that does the automated analysis of the uploaded photos was developed earlier in the [imgpheno](https://github.com/naturalis/imgpheno) repo and the [sticky-traps-data](https://github.com/naturalis/sticky-trap-data) repo.


# Structure of project.
This project spans three different repos.

* 'naturalis/sticky-trap-data'
  This repo contains the first code developed during the course of the project.
  
* 'naturalis/imgpheno'
  the code was copied here as soon as the initial functions where stable, and further development and integration into the imgpheno      package was done
  
* 'naturalis/nbclassify' 
  A simple website was developed here in the sticky-traps branch based on the website developed for the Orchid application.
  The code was altered slightly for simpler integration into the website and improved usability.
