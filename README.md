# NBClassify

This repository contains code and examples that demonstrate the ability for
artificial neural networks to classify images of orchid species. The layout
is as follows:

* `doc/`: Contains documentation.
* `html/`: Contains a web application for image classification. It implements
  the `nbclassify` package.
* `nbclassify/`: A Python package for image fingerprinting (using  the
  [ImgPheno][1] package) and recognition via artificial neural networks.
