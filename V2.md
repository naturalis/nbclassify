Description of the proposed research
------------------------------------

6a Science: Background, research questions, approach, and innovation
====================================================================
_Please indicate the addressed data science problem, the approach, the specific 
top-sector related use case(s) and the relation of the proposed solution with 
state-of-the-art developments (±200 words)._

The large-scale digitization of natural history collections is generating a 
wealth of image data that, if processed using state-of-the-art image analysis 
and machine learning algorithms, will constitute an unparalleled knowledge base 
of forms seen in the natural world. Firstly, knowledge extracted from image data 
will enrich collections themselves, by making size, shape, color, and, at more 
sophisticated levels of image analysis, taxonomic classification and other 
properties of the digitized object computable and verifiable against collection 
metadata. Secondly, this knowledge will provide the impetus for further research
in comparative biology because extracted image features will quantify 
differences and similarities in form, such that phenomena such as mimicry, 
convergent evolution, sexual dimorphism, gynandromorphy, phenotypic character 
displacement and functional morphological traits become amenable to direct 
statistical analysis at large scales.

- Digitization of natural history collection specimens has created a flood
  of image data to which image feature extraction, semantic annotation, and
  image classification methods can be applied.
- The development and application of these methods feeds back in a number of
  different directions: i) collections themselves are enriched with the
  knowledge extracted from images (e.g. incorrect classifications may be
  detected); ii) extracted features can inform further research in comparative 
  biology (e.g. because functional traits, gynandromorphy, minicry or√ other
  forms of convergent evolution, and phenotypic character displacement can be 
  quantified); iii) classifiers trained on reference data sets can be used in 
  field guides and identification apps.

6b eScience: Technologies, methods, and expected impact of the research
=======================================================================
_Please indicate which key technological challenges are dealt with (e.g.
optimized data handling, big data analytics, efficient computing), which
eScience tools will be developed, applied (re-used), integrated, or extended,
and how the developed solutions help to solve the sector-related use 
case(s)._

### Automated detection of edges and pseudo-landmarks
In our pilot, the extraction of salient features that capture colour 
distributions on an image, e.g. by computing histograms of RGB values across 
the horizontal and vertical axes, gave reasonable results for objects with 
fairly homogenous colours (i.e. orchid flowers photographed in standardized 
positions). Likewise, image feature algorithms that detect contrasting patches, 
such as the patterns on butterfly wings, were detected successfully with the
SURF algorithm, and subsequently registered using a bag-of-words approach. But,
in many image recognition cases applied to living organisms (e.g. insect wings,
leaves, wood anatomy), the patterns of veins and the relative locations of 
splits are the most discriminating. To use these as image features, edge 
detection algorithms need to be tested and combined with image registration 
algorithms to automatically detect salient landmarks.

### Scale and rotation-invariant classification
In the case of the pilot for the slipper orchids, we selected images taken in
nature but with standardized orientation and a facility to crop user-provided
images to a region of interest containing only a single flower, photographed
from the front. Likewise, for the case of the Javanese butterflies, all 
specimens in our set had been photographed in a standard orientation and all
specimens were preserved with folded wings, i.e. in all cases the bottom side
of the wing was photographed. In practice, specimens are preserved in a variety
of different ways, with wings folded in different directions, as pinned 
specimens, and so on. Such variation in scale and rotation, as well as visual 
clutter, is even more pronounced for photographs taken 'in the wild'.

### Semantic annotation of images

Re-use, sustainability, dissemination and collaborations
========================================================
'''Please indicate how the proposed technological solutions will find use 
beyond the target use case(s), how maintenance and sustainability will be 
secured and managed, which futher collaborations are foreseen, and which 
efforts will be made to promote the results of the project.'''


Data management
===============
1. Is data generated or collected during the research that is appropriate for 
   re-use?
2. Where will this data be stored during the research?
3. After the project has been completed, how will the data be stored for long-
   term and made available for the use by third parties? To whom will the data
   be accessible?
4. Which facilities (ICT, (secure) archive, refrigerators or legal expertise)
   do you expect will be needed for the storage of data during the research
   and after the research? Are these available?

### Image management
Sets of training images need to be managed by a system that meets the following
requirements:
- Different projects can have different sets of images such that the 
  application can switch between projects and extract features, train 
  classifiers and perform cross-validation on the set of a project. For
  example, the image management system might have a metaphor for albums
  such that every project has an album.
- Individual images can be tagged with multiple key/value pairs so that every
  image can be tagged with the taxonomic classification (in multiple levels)
  of the species in the image. Other key/value pairs can be applied as well.,
  for example to track image provenance, licensing, camera settings, etc.
- The image management system is 'in the cloud' so that images can be accessed
  through an API that allows headless servers to download sets of images for
  processing and analysis.
- The image management system has a graphical user interface so that non-
  technical users can upload, download, organize, and tag images in batches.

Software sustainability
=======================
1. Is software generated during the project that is appropriate for re-use? If
   so, please indicate which software will be appropriate for re-use.
2. How will the software appropriate for re-use be licensed and made available
   to third parties?
3. What measures are needed to make the software appropriate for long-term re-
   use for third parties?
4. In your expectation, how large is the expected community that will 
   potentially use the software, and do you expect outside contributors to the
   software?
5. What expertise do you expect to be needed to make the software appropriate 
   for long-term re-use by third parties? Is this expertise available? Please
   state what your expectations are of the contribution from the e-Science 
   Center in making the software appropriate for long-term re-use.
