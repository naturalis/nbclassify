Description of the proposed research
------------------------------------

6a Science: Background, research questions, approach, and innovation
====================================================================
_Please indicate the addressed data science problem, the approach, the specific 
top-sector related use case(s) and the relation of the proposed solution with 
state-of-the-art developments (±200 words)._

The large-scale digitization of natural history collections is generating a 
wealth of image data that, if processed using image feature extraction and 
classification algorithms, will constitute an unparalleled knowledge base of 
forms seen in the natural world. Among the many ways in which extracted image 
features and image classification can be applied, is the potential to automate 
taxonomic identification using image data of one of the world's most important 
disease vectors: mosquitoes. Diseases spread by mosquitoes are usually specific 
to only some mosquito genera or species, and so advances in correct 
identification of mosquitoes will improve assessment of the risks posed by their 
presence. The research we here propose to this end thus contributes directly to 
the "top sector" Life Science and Health. 

In recent years, the consortium members have already assembled globally-sampled 
mosquito specimen collections (CML, Naturalis), digitized these and compiled 
image banks (Naturalis); developed prototype open source software frameworks for
image feature extraction and classification (Naturalis); and developed advanced 
expertise in artificial intelligence applied to taxonomic classification of 
images (LIACS). Our preliminary tests of low-cost photography of mosquito wings
using smartphone clip-on lenses, and our preliminary successes with the current 
state-of-the-art in supervised learning of convolutional neural networks applied
to image sets of collection specimens, suggest that an automated identification 
system that operates on photos of mosquito wings taken 'in the field' using 
smartphones is feasible.

6b eScience: Technologies, methods, and expected impact of the research
=======================================================================
_Please indicate which key technological challenges are dealt with (e.g.
optimized data handling, big data analytics, efficient computing), which
eScience tools will be developed, applied (re-used), integrated, or extended,
and how the developed solutions help to solve the sector-related use 
case(s) (±200 words)._

The proposed research will modify and extend an open source framework developed 
at Naturalis (http://github.com/naturalis/img-classify-all) consisting of the 
following components:
- *Reference image management and annotation* In the current prototype, this is 
  done using the image hosting platform Flickr.com. Although this provides a 
  convenient system for managing and annotating images and accessing them via an
  API, the facilities for semantic annotation of images are rudimentary and the 
  API is not sufficiently scalable. One of the key contributions by the 
  e-Science Center to the proposed research would be to replace this prototype 
  with a fit-for-purpose solution for image management and annotation.
- *Image analysis and neural network training* At present, image features are 
  extracted by a library based on OpenCV, and classification is done using the 
  library for fully-connected artificial neural networks FANN. The key 
  contributions by the requested PD will be to extend image feature extraction 
  to edge detection (i.e. to detect veins) and to add the option to use 
  convolutional neural networks based on VGGNet instead of FANN.
- *Out-of-sample classification interface* Part of our framework is a web 
  application suitable both for desktop and mobile usage that provides a 
  graphical user interface with which end users can upload their photos for 
  automated classification. A demo version that operates on photographs of 
  slipper orchids, hosted on Naturalis's private cloud, can be found here: 
  http://orch-id.naturalis.nl
With the proposed extensions and modifications, a ready-to-use system will come
into existence with which end users can identify mosquitoes, and assess the 
health risks they pose, on their mobile devices.

6c Re-use, sustainability, dissemination and collaborations
===========================================================
_Please indicate how the proposed technological solutions will find use beyond 
the target use case(s), how maintenance and sustainability will be secured and 
managed, which futher collaborations are foreseen, and which efforts will be 
made to promote the results of the project (±200 words)._

The framework described in the previous section was specifically designed and is
intended to be agnostic as to the specific problem set. For example, we have 
already applied this framework to the automated recognition of flowers of 
slipper orchids, an endangered group of orchids in which trade is restricted and
which therefore need to be recognizable by customs officials in order to be able
to combat wildlife crime, and we are also applying the framework to the
recognition of butterfly specimens in a project that is currently and for the
coming XXX years receiving funding from the Van Groenendael-Krijger Foundation.
As such, the proposed technology is evidently applicable beyond the target use 
case. Given that the current use cases fit within Naturalis's capacity for
hosting web applications and HPC virtualization, and given that the lion's share
of the software development and workflow execution has been done by 
undergraduate students, maintenance and sustainability at present levels are 
secured. That said, we foresee a need for more sophisticated client side (i.e.
smartphone end user) functionality. To this end, we have entered into an 
agreement with the not-for-profit Stichting Akvo.org, whose "Flow" platform for 
digital data capture under field conditions in developing nations we will pitch
in upcoming CfPs that allow for field work components spearheaded by consortium
partner CML (an example of such a CfP will be the 2018 call by the JRS 
Foundation).

6d Data management
==================
1. _Is data generated or collected during the research that is appropriate for 
   re-use?_ Yes: reference image sets of mosquito specimens.
2. _Where will this data be stored during the research?_ Our current 
   implementation uses Flickr.com. Section 6b discusses our needs for a better
   solution.
3. _After the project has been completed, how will the data be stored for long-
   term and made available for the use by third parties? To whom will the data
   be accessible?_ Besides Flickr.com (which we prefer to replace), we are able
   to store image data long-term in Naturalis's "beeld bank". That said, we are
   keen to deploy a more fit-for-purpose solution in collaboration with the 
   e-Science Center. All image data generated by Naturalis, including ours, are 
   available to anyone under a CC0 license.
4. _Which facilities (ICT, (secure) archive, refrigerators or legal expertise)
   do you expect will be needed for the storage of data during the research
   and after the research? Are these available?_ We need a facility for storing,
   managing, annotating, and accessing (via API) our image data. As noted above,
   several options are available (Flickr.com, or at Naturalis), but the key 
   contribution we request from the e-Science Center is in this area.

6e Software sustainability
==========================
1. _Is software generated during the project that is appropriate for re-use? If
   so, please indicate which software will be appropriate for re-use._ The open
   source framework discussed under 6b and available at 
   http://github.com/naturalis/img-classify-all
2. _How will the software appropriate for re-use be licensed and made available
   to third parties?_ The image feature extraction component is available under 
   the terms of the MIT license. The classification system and the web 
   application are available under the Apache license. All source code 
   components are under version control hosted by Github.com, for which 
   Naturalis has a commercial license and for which it makes local, permanent 
   backups in its private infrastructure (a Ceph-based object store).      
3. _What measures are needed to make the software appropriate for long-term re-
   use for third parties?_ None beyond the measures already taken.
4. _In your expectation, how large is the expected community that will 
   potentially use the software, and do you expect outside contributors to the
   software?_ For the target use case of mosquito identification we have 
   previously developed a conservative scenario based on the deployment of 
   the "Flow" platform in malaria-prone areas of South Africa for which we
   projected XXX users (YYY data captures). However, we suspect that a 
   functioning, easy-to-use, mobile system for mosquito identification by 
   non-technical users may attract many, many more users.
5. _What expertise do you expect to be needed to make the software appropriate 
   for long-term re-use by third parties? Is this expertise available? Please
   state what your expectations are of the contribution from the e-Science 
   Center in making the software appropriate for long-term re-use._ The key 
   challenge is the management of annotated reference image data sets. We will 
   need to be able to manage these collaboratively, have a flexible facility
   for semantic annotation, be able to access these through an API, and be able 
   to grow these data sets with images uploaded by end users. For this we will 
   need the help of the e-Science Center.

6f Use national e-infrastructure
================================
_Please indicate the project’s (national) e-Infrastructure needs, in terms of 
compute hours, data storage capacity, lightpath connectivity, or otherwise._
As noted above, we will need an image management facility. Besides this, we
currently perform neural network training, and are running the web application,
on Naturalis's private cloud. At present, the resource use fits well within
Naturalis's in-house capacity. However, under a scenario where the web app for
mosquito identification works well and "goes viral", our e-Infrastructure needs
may grow such that we may need to deploy the app image elsewhere.
